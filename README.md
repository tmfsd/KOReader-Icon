New icons for the KOReader app on PocketBook devices that fit the style of the current PocketBook OS. Its not pixel perfect, but I think its good enough.

**Only tested on a PocketBook Era Color!**

Instructions for how to change the app icon (and the name of the app) can be found here: https://github.com/jjrrw174/PocketBook-Desktop-and-App-Customizations/tree/main
